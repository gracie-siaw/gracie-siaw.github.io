    <h1> The Problem </h1>
    <p> What are food deserts: geographical Areas where shopping for healthy and    affordable food is difficult because of the economic circumstances hindering the community to buy nutritious alternatives or the lack of local healthy food options available. Unfortunately, food deserts are most prevalent in Black and Brown urban or rural low income communities.

    <div class="cause-col">
       <h1> Cause </h1>
        <p> One of the major causes for food deserts is poverty. Those living in food deserts are mostly low income communities, populations where they are already facing other expenses that might demand more of their resources. As long as communities cannot afford basic food essentials, they will be pushed to use the cheaper and less nutritious option for food. The daispries in resources also manifested from systemic issues. After slavery, communities of color were restricted in buying homes due to redlining, which “enforced unfavorable loan treatment.” This means Black and Brown families are not able to build their lives in affluent communities but rather in services deprived areas they could get a loan for. This causes a lock of social mobility in these communities and withholds these familie to poorer regions which do not have the accessibility resources that others face- like many healthy food establishments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="eff-col">
        <h1> Effects </h1>
          <p> Those in these communities often resort to shopping at their closest convenience store or buying  fast food restaurants. These establishments offer cheaper foods, but sadly, are full of saturated fats and calories.This puts resdines in food deserts at risk of diet related health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other bad health outcomes. At the end of the day, poor health can result in poor standard of living and opportunities.

        <h1>Solutions</h1>
          <p> For policymakers, produce subsidies are a way to incentivize farmers to get fresh produce in the hands of communities in need and get communities to put these produce on their plate. A subsidy is government money granted to assist an industry in ensuring that the price of a commodity or service may remain low. According to a TIME 2016 article, government subsidies emplaced at the time heavily linked the food items to unhealthy processed food.
          </p>
          <p> Another action that can be acted is giving incentives to businesses to locate in food deserts. Distance and lack of transportation are two of the biggest contributing factors to food deserts. We can target food deserts by allocating more business into these areas so residents will have the means to buy healthier food.</p>

        <h1>Things You Can Do</h1>
          <p> Community members are  taking action in their own hands. Like Jamiah Hargins who is the founder of Asante Microfarm, an idea to transform a front yard garden into a micro farm. One idea to get healthy produce in the grocery bags of a community is starting a produce stand or small farm. Another is supporting local farmer markets. Cooperating with nonprofits is a good way to help as well. Whether volunteering or donating, these organizations were made on the basis of enriching the lives of the neighborhood. Here resources for local farmer markets in Oakland. </p>
